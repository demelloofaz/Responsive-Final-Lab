    <h4>Fix A Flat Tire</h4>
    <p>
      Flat tires on your bicycle, while frustrating, are easily dealt with if you’re prepared. Always carry a spare tube, repair kit, tire levers and a pump and follow these simple directions to get back on the road quickly.
      <br>
      Here are the basic steps to fixing a flat:
      <ol>
      <li>Remove the bike wheel</li>
      <li>Remove the tube</li>
      <li>Find the cause of the flat</li>
      <li>Repair or replace the tube</li>
      <li>Reinstall the bike wheel</li>

    <h4>Lubing a bike chain</h4>
    <p>
      Chain lubrication is one of the most important parts of proper bicycle maintenance. A dried out, rusted chain can negatively impact shifting performance and hurt the life of your entire drivetrain. You should be regularly lubricating your chain and we want to show you how to do it the right way. Learn how to lube a bike chain with pro mechanic Daniel Slusser. If you're short on supplies, Art's Cyclery stocks a full range of chain lubricants.
      <ol>
      <li>Shift your chain into the large chain ring in the front and the small cog in the rear</li>
      <li>Hold a rag on the chain and back-pedal to remove all the excess dirt from the chain</li>
      <li>You can very carefully lube each link of the chain or just squeeze on the lube while back-pedaling until you coat the entire chain. Less is more!</li>
      <li>Hold your rag on the chain again while back-pedaling to remove any excess lubricant</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cleaning your bike</h4>
    <p>
      While there are some overly anal oddballs out there who meticulously polish their headset spacers with Q-tips, most of us treat bike cleaning as a quick chore—if we do it at all.
      <br>
      But in your rush to get the job done, you can make mistakes that could hurt everything from your ego to the life span of your components. Here are four bummers to avoid, and three bike-washing tips to make tidying up a cleaner experience.
    <h5>The Rinse</h5>
    Don't skip the initial rinse. Otherwise, you'll end up swirling around every bit of gritty debris and scratching your
    frame's glossy finish. Using the light-shower setting on your garden hose, spray off your entire bike top to bottom before
     you go near it with a soapy sponge.
     <h5>High Pressure Hazard</h5>
     Go full-throttle with a hose and you could force water (soapy, potentially degreaser-laden water) into bearings.
     The degraded grease will then give out before its time.
     <h5>Skip the polish</h5>
     Polishing products like Armor All aren't for your bike. Shine up your saddle and you'll have a hard time staying seated.
      Go glossy on your tires, and rim residue will reduce braking power. Skip it.
