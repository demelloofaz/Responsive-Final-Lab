      I live in Arizona which some people would think,  why on earth would you ever need to use an indoor trainer. However
      the summer's here are absolutely insane.  Day after day of 100+ degree heat, and then there is a 6 week period of heat combined with humidity.
      Normally it is very dry here.  This is one major reason I train indoors for large parts of the year.
    </P>
    <p>The other reason for training indoors is that while the weather is nice for a majority of the year.  I do not like spending all of my time riding outside
      without some sort of plan.  First I live in a part of Phoenix that is pretty void of hills.  I like to get my workouts done in a short period of time so taking
        time to drive to a hillier location is usually not an option.  Secondly, there are not alot of sections of road where there is not some sort of traffic
        control.  This means that doing things like intervals of longer periods is usually out of the question.  Also sometimes it is hard
        for me to keep myslef motivated to actually do the complete interval.

    These are just a few reasons why you may want to consider doing some form of indoor training.  Initially I started indoor training on a spin bike at a gym
    during a soin class.  However, while this was motivating one of the big issues I found was that the bikes tended to not have seats
    which are more like a true road bike seat.  Additionally, the bikes would vary from bike to bike in terms of the resistance and the
    adjustability of the resistance.  And finally, much of the time the rooms were kept way to warm with in adequate air flow.
    So given I was paying a monthly fee for this, I decided that money could be better spent on a good trainer and some
    online training applications.

     <strong>There are a few things one should consider when setting up the workout area</strong>
     <ul>
       <li>Room Temperature -  Want it as cool as possible</li>
       <li>Well Ventilated - The more airflow the better since there is no wind indoors</li>
       <li>Access to Audio or Video - I prefer video on a 32 inch screen</li>
       <li>Away from busy rooms of the house - never know when you will want to workout while others are asleep</li>
       <li>Flooring material -  May need a mat under the bike for noise or sweat</li>
