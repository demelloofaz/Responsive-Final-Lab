       <h3>Trainer Types</h3>
       <p>
         There are four main types of bike trainers. Wind, or resistance, trainers are popular for their simplicity,
         affordability, and durability. Resistance levels increase the harder or faster you pedal. With this type of trainer,
          your own pedaling powers a fan for resistance. A magnetic trainer offers fixed resistance using magnetic force.
          Unlike a wind trainer, you can’t change the resistance level by pedaling harder or faster. This type of trainer is
          ideal for longer, steadier rides. A fluid trainer offers progressive resistance, and the levels will increase the harder
          and faster you pedal.
       </p>
       Roller bike trainers can be deceptive, as they look quite simple. Despite its basic design, this type of roller
       is challenging as it requires you to stay balanced and upright on your bike. Unlike a typical bike trainer,
       there is no stand to hold your bike in place. Regardless of which type of bike trainer you choose, you’ll want one
       that’s sturdy and durable enough to withstand the demands of your indoor training sessions.
       If you’re up for the challenge, consider these top best bike rollers.
       <p>
        Another category of train is the Smart trainer.  These trainers are an increasingly popular option among cyclists who don’t mind spending a bit more for a more
        technology-filled training session. Whether you want continuous feedback during a ride or are just intrigued by the
        technology, this type of trainer typically keeps track of your speed, cadence, power, and more. Many of these trainers
        are either ANT+ compatible, meaning they need a separate dongle to work properly, or Bluetooth-ready.
        Once your smart trainer is properly set up you can start on a virtual ride to inject a bit more variety and excitement into a typical indoor training ride.
       </p>
       <p>
         For many cyclists, the method of attachment is a primary concern. Some trainers let you directly attach the rear
         axle and cassette, which replaces the rear wheel of the bike. This option can help save your bike’s tire while providing a smoother
         connection. However, not every axle or drivetrain is compatible with this type of trainer. Bike trainers with a traditional wheel
         drive operate by pressing against the rear tire. While this option is typically less expensive than direct mount trainers
         it can also produce more noise and wear out tires relatively quickly. This can be remedied by a special indorr trainer tire.
         but will then mean having to change the tire or wheel when wanting to use the bike for outdoor riding.
